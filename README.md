## Context

Cardiac Coherence is a breathing technic on which respiration does not change rythm for an expanded period of time as a way to relieve stress.  
I've been on YouTube watching those videos before... But i grew tired of voices telling me to breath in and out and the fact that I couldn't change the background sounds.  

So I've made this app, completetly from scratch, without knowledge on Android Studio and Kotlin (I've programmed with Java, but never for an Android app).
To learn how it works, I've read documentation when i ran into a stop and tried to comply with the Material3 UI rules.

I am well aware that this app needs improvment UI wise and code wise: but it suits my needs for now.  
When those improvments are done, I'll probably publish it on teh Google Play Store.
